#  Autonomous City Intelligence System

An **AI-powered smart city management platform** that autonomously detects traffic congestion, emergencies, and road hazards through **computer vision and real-time data**, enabling instant response actions, rerouting, and alerts to authorities and citizens.

---

##  Problem Statement

Urban traffic and emergency management often rely on **manual and delayed systems**, leading to:

* Prolonged congestion and traffic jams
* Slow emergency responses
* Inefficient coordination among city departments
* Wasted resources and reduced public safety

---

##  Our Solution

The **Autonomous City Intelligence System (ACIS)** is designed to make city management **truly autonomous** by:

* Detecting **congestion, accidents, and emergencies** using AI
* **Automatically adjusting** signals or rerouting traffic
* **Sending real-time alerts** to authorities and citizens
* Enabling the **public to report issues** such as roadblocks or accidents
* Continuously **learning and improving** with feedback data
